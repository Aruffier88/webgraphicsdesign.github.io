 Bootstrap is a great resource for building quick, responsive and attractive websites. As I began learning html and CSS I was starting to feel frustrated because a lot of times, no matter how much I researched, I couldn't replicate the seamless look of a lot of the websites out there, but I now understand that so many websites are beautiful and seamless because of open source resources like bootstrap. Now I can really put the websites I design in my head out there on the web! Bootstrap is a great resource for building quick, responsive and attractive websites. Many small business owners might not have the budget to outsource the design of their website, and need to create beautiful easy to use websites but don't have time to learn all the skills. With open sources like bootstrap anyone can create a proffesional looking website that works on all devices!

   One negative I found, as an aspiring digital designer, I worry that this might put me out of a job! With all these resources available for anyone, how do I justify the time I put into learning these markup languages from scratch?

   Some other features Bootstrap includes are icons through font awesome and combiled JavaScript. Instead of typing line by line you can look for the functionality you want your website to have and quickly add it to your exisiting code. I was able to add a phone icon that will dial directly to my number from any mobile device as well as a mail icon that will e-mail me directly. These icons are universally recognized so I'm not risking reinventing the wheel with a new icon. Although again, am I putting myself out of a job?
